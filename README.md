# Comparing Fluorescence and Bioluminescence Microscopy: The Effect of Autofluorescence in *C. elegans*
Bachelor's Thesis conducted at ICFO (Institute of Photonic Sciences), Barcelona.

## Motivation

What is science? It is the art of shedding light on the principles of nature, and understanding our surroundings and the world we live in. Observation was the first step towards science, followed by the attempt to explain and understand what had been witnessed. This idea lead to the development of microscopes. Techniques rapidly improved, until In the 20th century 
**Fluorescence microscopy** became a new powerful tool for studying biological matter. Later, in 2010, the use of **bioluminescence** for depicting features hidden to the bare eyes emerged. It is a fairly new idea, that might in future replace the current standard, i.e. **Fluorescence microscopy**, since the latter technique features several drawbacks, such as so-called **autofluorescence**. This research project aims at shedding light onto the contrasting features of both imaging methods, by giving special attention to **autofluorescence**. For this purpose, **C. elegans** is used as an experimental model.

## Project Overview

This research project investigates the disturbing effect of autofluorescence (natural emission of light by biological structures other than the labeled feature) over time in microscopy imaging of *Caenorhabditis elegans*. As organisms age, autofluorescence increases and can interfere with the visualization of fluorescent signals, making it challenging to study labeled neurons in aging animals.


### Research Focus

- **Model organism**: Two transgenic strains of *C. elegans* with mNeonGreen-labeled touch receptor neurons
- **Imaging techniques**: Fluorescence microscopy vs. bioluminescence microscopy
- **Age progression**: Samples imaged at different developmental stages to assess autofluorescence accumulation
- **Analysis**: Spatial intensity distributions and signal quantification across body parts (extrachromosomal and integrated strains, tails, bodies, mNeonGreen-spectra, and mCherry-spectra)

### Key Findings

- **Autofluorescence behavior**: Autofluorescence increases with age in fluorescence microscopy, creating a "veil" that obscures neuronal signals
- **Bioluminescence advantage**: Bioluminescence methods maintain consistently visible neuronal signals regardless of sample age
- **Signal-to-autofluorescence ratio**: Decreases over time in fluorescence imaging, demonstrating the progressive interference
- **Strain differences**: Extrachromosomal strains show higher data variability compared to integrated strains
- **Optimal conditions**: mCherry wavelength range and tail tissue analysis provide better fluorescence imaging results

### Main Conclusion

**Bioluminescence microscopy demonstrates superior suitability for imaging aging *C. elegans* samples**, as it avoids the autofluorescence interference that progressively degrades fluorescence imaging quality over time.
